## Executive Summary

PacketFlow is a declarative, capability-based distributed systems framework built on Elixir/OTP that enables organizations to build, deploy, and scale distributed capabilities across network boundaries. Unlike traditional RPC or REST-based architectures, PacketFlow models distributed functionality as **declarative capabilities** with explicit intents, requirements, effects, and execution contexts.

### Key Innovation

PacketFlow introduces the concept of **Capability-Oriented Architecture (COA)**, where distributed systems are composed of discrete, discoverable, and executable capabilities that can be dynamically invoked across process and network boundaries with built-in observability, tracing, and effect management.

### Primary Use Cases

- **Microservices Orchestration**: Replace complex service meshes with declarative capability networks
- **Real-time Distributed Applications**: WebSocket-native capability execution with Phoenix integration
- **AI/ML Pipeline Coordination**: Distributed AI capabilities with automatic context propagation
- **Event-Driven Architectures**: Capability-based event processing with built-in effects
- **Developer Tooling**: Framework for building distributed development tools and APIs

---

## System Overview

### Architecture Philosophy

PacketFlow is built on four foundational principles:

1. **Capabilities Over Services**: Instead of thinking in terms of services and endpoints, PacketFlow models functionality as capabilities with explicit contracts
2. **Declarative Over Imperative**: Capabilities are declared with intent, requirements, and effects rather than implemented as imperative code
3. **Observable By Default**: Every capability execution is automatically traced, logged, and metered
4. **Distribution Native**: Designed from the ground up for distributed execution across network boundaries

## Core Architecture

### Macro-Based Capability Definition

PacketFlow uses Elixir macros to provide a declarative DSL for defining capabilities. This approach enables:

- **Compile-time validation** of capability contracts
- **Automatic code generation** for boilerplate (validation, effects, telemetry)
- **Static analysis** of capability dependencies and requirements
- **Documentation generation** from capability definitions

```elixir
capability :user_transform do
  intent "Transform user data with specified operations"
  requires [:user_id, :operations]
  provides [:transformed_user, :operation_log]
  
  effect :audit_log, level: :info
  effect :metrics, type: :counter, name: "user_transforms"
  
  execute fn payload, context ->
    # Implementation
  end
end
```

### Registry-Based Discovery

Central to PacketFlow is the **Capability Registry**, a GenServer-based process that maintains:

- **Capability Metadata**: Intent, requirements, provides, effects
- **Module Mappings**: Which modules implement which capabilities  
- **User Permissions**: Who can access which capabilities
- **Runtime State**: Active capability executions and their contexts

### Wire Protocol Design

PacketFlow defines a versioned, extensible wire protocol for capability-based communication:

```elixir
%{
  version: "1.0",
  type: :capability_request,
  intent: "Transform user profile data",
  capability_id: :user_profile_transform,
  payload: %{user_id: "123", operations: [...]},
  context: %{user_id: "456", session_id: "abc", trace_id: "xyz"},
  metadata: %{priority: :high, timeout: 30_000}
}
```

---

## Component Design

### 1. Capability Definition Layer (`PacketFlow.Capability`)

**Purpose**: Provides the macro-based DSL for declaring capabilities with contracts, effects, and execution logic.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Parse capability definitions at compile time
- Generate validation functions for requirements/provides
- Register capability metadata in module attributes
- Create execution wrappers with effect handling

**Design Patterns**:
- **Macro Expansion**: Capabilities are expanded into functions at compile time
- **Attribute Accumulation**: Uses `@capabilities` to collect definitions
- **Effect Composition**: Multiple effects can be attached to single capabilities

**Integration Points**:
- Generates functions consumed by the Registry
- Produces metadata used by the Wire Protocol
- Creates execution contexts used by Effects Layer

### 2. Wire Protocol Layer (`PacketFlow.WireProtocol`)

**Purpose**: Defines the message format and serialization for capability-based communication.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Message encoding/decoding with version compatibility
- Message validation and structure enforcement
- Request/response/error message construction
- Protocol versioning and evolution support

**Design Patterns**:
- **Versioned Protocol**: Each message includes version for compatibility

- **Context Enrichment**: Automatically adds session/user context to requests
- **Error Boundary**: Isolates client errors from system failures

**Integration Points**:
- Receives messages from Wire Protocol Layer
- Routes capability requests to Registry
- Manages client connections and sessions

### 4. Registry Layer (`PacketFlow.CapabilityRegistry`)

**Purpose**: Central registry managing capability discovery, authorization, and execution.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Capability module registration and metadata storage
- User-based capability filtering and authorization
- Capability execution coordination and context management
- Discovery API for listing available capabilities

**Design Patterns**:
- **GenServer State Machine**: Maintains registry state with concurrent access

### 5. Effects Layer (Distributed across components)

**Purpose**: Provides observability, logging, metrics, and side-effect management for capability execution.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Automatic audit logging of capability executions
- Telemetry integration for metrics and monitoring
- Distributed tracing support with trace ID propagation
- Effect composition and execution ordering

**Design Patterns**:
- **Effect as Data**: Effects are data structures, not functions
- **Automatic Execution**: Effects execute automatically during capability execution
- **Composable Effects**: Multiple effects can be attached to capabilities
- **Pluggable Backends**: Effects can be routed to different backends (Logger, Telemetry, custom)

**Integration Points**:
- Triggered by Capability Definition Layer during execution
- Integrates with standard Elixir observability tools
- Produces data consumed by monitoring systems

## Wire Protocol Specification

### Message Structure

All PacketFlow messages follow a consistent structure:

```elixir
@type wire_message :: %{
  version: String.t(),           # Protocol version (e.g., "1.0")
  type: message_type(),          # Message type enum
  intent: String.t(),            # Human-readable intent description
  capability_id: atom(),         # Unique capability identifier  
  payload: map(),                # Capability-specific data
  context: context(),            # Execution context
  metadata: map()                # Optional metadata
}

@type message_type :: 
  :capability_request |
  :capability_response | 
  :capability_error |
  :heartbeat

@type context :: %{
  user_id: String.t(),           # Authenticated user identifier
  session_id: String.t(),        # Session identifier
  timestamp: DateTime.t(),       # Message timestamp
  trace_id: String.t(),          # Distributed tracing ID
  optional(atom()) => any()      # Additional context fields
}
```

### Message Types

#### Capability Request
```elixir
%{
  version: "1.0",
  type: :capability_request,
  intent: "Transform user profile with validation",
  capability_id: :user_profile_transform,
  payload: %{
    user_id: "user_123",
    transformations: [:normalize_email, :validate_phone],
    validation_rules: [:email_required, :phone_format]
  },
  context: %{
    user_id: "admin_456", 
    session_id: "sess_abc123",
    timestamp: ~U[2025-07-31 10:30:00Z],
    trace_id: "trace_xyz789"
  },
  metadata: %{priority: :normal, timeout: 30_000}
}
```

#### Capability Response
```elixir
%{
  version: "1.0",
  type: :capability_response,
  intent: "Transform user profile with validation",
  capability_id: :user_profile_transform,
  payload: %{
    transformed_profile: %{user_id: "user_123", email: "user@example.com"},
    validation_results: %{valid?: true, errors: []},
    operation_log: %{operations_applied: 2, duration_ms: 45}
  },
  context: %{...},  # Same as request
  metadata: %{execution_time_ms: 47, cache_hit: false}
}
```

#### Capability Error
```elixir
%{
  version: "1.0",
  type: :capability_error,
  intent: "Transform user profile with validation", 
  capability_id: :user_profile_transform,
  payload: %{
    error: %{
      type: :validation_failed,
      message: "Invalid email format",
      details: %{field: :email, value: "invalid-email"}
    }
  },
  context: %{...},
  metadata: %{error_code: "E001", retry_after: 1000}
}
```

### Protocol Evolution

PacketFlow supports protocol evolution through:

- **Version Negotiation**: Clients and servers negotiate compatible versions
- **Backward Compatibility**: Newer versions maintain compatibility with older clients
- **Feature Detection**: Capabilities can advertise supported protocol features
- **Graceful Degradation**: Unknown fields are ignored, enabling progressive enhancement

## Data Flow & Message Lifecycle

### Request Lifecycle

```
[Client] → [Channel] → [Protocol] → [Registry] → [Capability] → [Effects]
    ↓         ↓          ↓           ↓            ↓            ↑
[WebSocket] [Auth] [Decode/Validate] [Discover] [Execute] [Log/Metric]
    ↑         ↑          ↑           ↑            ↑            ↓
[Client] ← [Channel] ← [Protocol] ← [Registry] ← [Response] ← [Effects]
```

### Detailed Flow

1. **Client Request**
   - Client constructs capability request message
   - Message sent over WebSocket to Phoenix Channel
   - Channel authenticates user and validates session

2. **Protocol Processing**
   - Channel receives raw message payload
   - Wire Protocol decodes and validates message structure
   - Message type routing determines next steps

3. **Registry Discovery**
   - Registry looks up capability by ID
   - Authorization check: can user execute this capability?
   - Context enrichment with session/trace information

4. **Capability Execution**
   - Registry delegates to appropriate capability module
   - Module validates required payload fields
   - Effects are executed (logging, metrics, etc.)
   - Main capability logic executes

5. **Response Generation**
   - Execution result is wrapped in response message
   - Response validated against capability's `provides` contract
   - Message encoded by Wire Protocol

6. **Client Response**
   - Encoded message sent back through WebSocket
   - Client receives and processes response
   - Optional client-side effects (UI updates, etc.)

### Error Handling Flow

Errors can occur at multiple layers, each with specific handling:

- **Transport Errors**: WebSocket disconnection, network issues
- **Protocol Errors**: Invalid message format, unsupported version  
- **Authorization Errors**: User lacks permission for capability
- **Validation Errors**: Payload missing required fields
- **Execution Errors**: Capability logic failure
- **System Errors**: GenServer crashes, resource exhaustion

Each error type results in a structured error response with appropriate metadata for debugging and client handling.

---

## Capability System Design

### Capability Contract

Every capability defines an explicit contract consisting of:

```elixir
%{
  id: :capability_name,           # Unique identifier
  intent: "Human description",    # What this capability does
  requires: [:field1, :field2],  # Required payload fields
  provides: [:result1, :result2], # Guaranteed response fields
  effects: [effect1, effect2],    # Side effects that will occur
  executor: function              # Implementation function
}
```

### Contract Validation

PacketFlow enforces contracts at multiple points:

- **Compile Time**: Macro expansion validates capability definitions
- **Request Time**: Payload validated against `requires` fields
- **Response Time**: Result validated against `provides` fields
- **Runtime**: Type checking and struct validation where applicable

### Effect System

Effects represent observable side effects of capability execution:

#### Audit Logging Effect
```elixir
effect :audit_log, level: :info
# Automatically logs capability execution with context
```

#### Metrics Effect  
```elixir
effect :metrics, type: :counter, name: "user_transforms"
# Emits Telemetry events for monitoring
```

#### Custom Effects
```elixir
effect :notification, channel: :slack, template: :capability_executed
# Custom effects can be defined for specific needs
```

### Capability Composition

PacketFlow supports several patterns for composing capabilities:

#### Sequential Composition
```elixir
# Execute capabilities in sequence, passing results forward
pipeline [:validate_user, :transform_profile, :save_profile]
```

#### Parallel Composition
```elixir
# Execute multiple capabilities concurrently
parallel [:send_email, :log_activity, :update_cache]
```

#### Conditional Composition
```elixir
# Execute capabilities based on conditions
conditional fn context -> context.user_type == :premium end,
  if_true: :premium_transform,
  if_false: :standard_transform
```

## Integration Patterns

### Phoenix Application Integration

PacketFlow integrates seamlessly with Phoenix applications:

```elixir
# In your Phoenix router
socket "/capabilities", PacketFlow.CapabilitySocket,
  websocket: true,
  longpoll: false

# In your endpoint
channel "capabilities:*", PacketFlow.CapabilityChannel
```

### Supervision Tree Integration

```elixir
# In your application supervisor
children = [
  PacketFlow.CapabilityRegistry,
  {Task, fn -> PacketFlow.register_capabilities() end}
]
```

### Testing Integration

PacketFlow provides testing utilities for capability validation:

```elixir
defmodule MyCapabilityTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  use PacketFlow.CapabilityTest

  test "user transform capability" do
    payload = %{user_id: "123", operations: [:normalize]}
    context = %{user_id: "admin", session_id: "sess"}
    
    assert {:ok, result} = execute_capability(:user_transform, payload, context)
    assert Map.has_key?(result, :transformed_user)
    assert_effect_executed(:audit_log)
    assert_metric_emitted("user_transforms")
  end
end
```

### External System Integration

#### Database Integration
```elixir
capability :user_query do
  requires [:query, :params]
  provides [:results, :metadata]
  
  effect :metrics, type: :histogram, name: "db_query_duration"
  
  execute fn payload, context ->
    {:ok, MyRepo.query(payload.query, payload.params)}
  end
end
```

#### AI/ML Service Integration
```elixir
capability :ai_analysis do
  requires [:data, :model_type]
  provides [:analysis_results, :confidence_score]
  
  effect :ai_logging, service: :openai
  
  execute fn payload, context ->
    OpenAI.analyze(payload.data, payload.model_type)
  end
end
```

---

## Observability & Monitoring

### Built-in Observability

PacketFlow provides comprehensive observability out of the box:

#### Automatic Logging
- Every capability execution is logged with structured data
- Configurable log levels per capability
- Automatic context propagation (user_id, session_id, trace_id)

#### Telemetry Integration
- Emits standardized Telemetry events
- Counter metrics for capability execution counts
- Histogram metrics for execution duration
- Custom metrics via effect definitions

#### Distributed Tracing
- Automatic trace ID generation and propagation
- Integration with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger
- Span creation for capability execution boundaries

### Monitoring Metrics

Key metrics automatically available:

```elixir
# Capability execution metrics
[:packetflow, :capability, :execution, :count]
[:packetflow, :capability, :execution, :duration] 
[:packetflow, :capability, :execution, :error]

# System metrics  
[:packetflow, :registry, :capabilities, :registered]
[:packetflow, :channel, :connections, :active]
[:packetflow, :protocol, :messages, :processed]

# Business metrics (custom per capability)
[:packetflow, :business, :user_transforms, :count]
[:packetflow, :business, :ai_queries, :duration]
```

### Health Checks

PacketFlow provides built-in health check capabilities:

```elixir
capability :system_health do
  intent "Report system health and status"
  requires []
  provides [:status, :checks, :metadata]
  
  execute fn _payload, context ->
    checks = [
      registry: PacketFlow.CapabilityRegistry.health_check(),
      database: check_database_connection(),
      external_services: check_external_dependencies()
    ]
    
    overall_status = if Enum.all?(checks, & &1.healthy?), do: :healthy, else: :degraded
    
    {:ok, %{
      status: overall_status,
      checks: checks,
      metadata: %{timestamp: DateTime.utc_now(), version: "1.0"}
    }}
  end
end
```

---

## Security Model

### Authentication

PacketFlow integrates with Phoenix's authentication system:

- **Channel Authentication**: Users authenticate when joining capability channels
- **Session Management**: Session validation on every capability request
- **Token Support**: JWT and session token authentication supported

### Authorization

Capability-level authorization with multiple strategies:

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```elixir
capability :admin_user_delete do
  requires [:user_id]
  authorize [:admin, :super_admin]
  
  execute fn payload, context ->
    # Only admins can execute this capability
  end
end
```

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
```elixir
capability :user_profile_update do
  requires [:user_id, :updates]
  authorize fn payload, context ->
    # Users can only update their own profiles
    payload.user_id == context.user_id or context.role == :admin
  end
  
  execute fn payload, context ->
    # Implementation
  end
end
```

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Schema Validation**: Payload validated against JSON Schema or Ecto schemas
- **Sanitization**: Automatic sanitization of string inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user, per-capability rate limiting
- **Size Limits**: Configurable payload size limits

### Audit Trail

Complete audit trail for security compliance:

- **Request Logging**: All capability requests logged with user context
- **Response Logging**: Responses logged (with configurable data masking)
- **Error Logging**: Security-relevant errors logged with enhanced context
- **Access Logging**: Capability access attempts logged regardless of success

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability Profile

PacketFlow is designed for horizontal scalability:

- **Stateless Capabilities**: No capability holds persistent state
- **Distributed Registry**: Registry can be clustered across nodes
- **Connection Pooling**: WebSocket connections efficiently managed
- **Async Execution**: Capability execution is fully asynchronous

### Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance characteristics (single node, typical hardware):

- **Capability Execution**: 1000-5000 capabilities/second (depending on complexity)
- **Message Throughput**: 10,000+ messages/second through WebSocket channels
- **Registry Lookups**: Sub-millisecond capability discovery
- **Memory Footprint**: ~50MB base + ~10KB per active capability

### Optimization Strategies

#### Capability Caching
```elixir
capability :expensive_computation do
  requires [:input_data]
  provides [:results]
  
  cache true, ttl: :timer.minutes(5)
  
  execute fn payload, context ->
    # Expensive computation cached for 5 minutes
  end
end
```

#### Async Execution
```elixir
capability :background_processing do
  requires [:job_data]
  provides [:job_id]
  
  async true
  
  execute fn payload, context ->
    # Returns immediately, processes in background
    job_id = start_background_job(payload.job_data)
    {:ok, %{job_id: job_id}}
  end
end
```

#### Connection Pooling
```elixir
# Automatic connection pooling for database capabilities
capability :user_query do
  requires [:query]
  provides [:results]
  
  pool :database, size: 10, max_overflow: 5
  
  execute fn payload, context ->
    # Uses pooled database connections
  end
end
```
